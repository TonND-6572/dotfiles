I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as a package config manager for convenience.  

Before stowing a package, make sure to remove or back up your old configs. Then, stow the package you want to use.  

### Example:
```sh
$ mv $HOME/.config/hypr $HOME/.config/hypr.bk
$ stow hyprland
```

Or, if you're a nerd, just copy it manually and f*ck stow.
